# Junior-Product-Manager-Challenge
My code works by loading the text file downloaded from the website, to execute it locally you need to create the table for the data to go and to change the file location that the data is read from
SELECT * FROM tableData
ORDER BY date ASC(or DESC)
selecting all should only show the dates that they have.
